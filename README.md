üöÄ MLGRush Plugin for Minecraft 1.8.9

üìù Overview

This MLGRush plugin implements the popular minigame mode often used for BedWars training. The goal is to destroy the opponent's "bed" by rapidly building bridges and knocking the enemy off with a knockback stick. The plugin is specifically developed for Minecraft Version 1.8.9 (Spigot/Bukkit).

This repository contains the full source code and is released to the community for maintenance, bug fixes, and future development. I will no longer be actively maintaining or developing this project.

‚ú® Key Features

    Dedicated 1.8.9 Support: Optimized for the classic 1.8 PvP experience.

    Arena System: Easy setup for multiple arenas (e.g., 1v1).

    Dynamic Gameplay: Instant respawn, automatic block reset, includes knockback stick and sandstone inventory items.

    Statistics System: [Mention if stats are included (MySQL/Flatfile): e.g., Tracks Kills, Deaths, Wins, and Winrate.]
